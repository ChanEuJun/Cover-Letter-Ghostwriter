# Cover-Letter-Ghostwriter

I created this to help me tailor cover letters to companies I really, really want to get into - the prompt uses a conversational method to gather context about your experiences, and puts it in an effective, killer format. I spend around 10 minutes feeding it context and another 10 editing the final product to make it more genuine and to add touches of my own personality.

You can install the markdown file and place it in the project files of ChatGPT, Claude, a Gemini Gem etc. 

Happy using and if you have feedback do reach out!
